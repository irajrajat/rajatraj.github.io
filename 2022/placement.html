                <p> Reading this, you are most likely preparing for the placement season. So, before anything else,
                    please take a deep breath and relax. I am Rajat Raj, currently a 4th-year student at dept. of
                    ECE. My interests are in the core electronics and communication domains, which inspired me to
                    pursue projects and internships in this domain. I was shortlisted for a number of core
                    companies, the most prominent of which were TI, AD, and Enphase. In this blog, I will be
                    covering my interview experience with Enphase Energy.
                </p>

                <p> Enphase Energy is a global energy technology company. The company delivers smart, 
                    easy-to-use solutions that manage solar generation, storage, and communication on 
                    one platform.

                <h2 class="section-heading">Experience:</h2>
                <h4 class="section-heading">Written Round</h4>
                <p> <li> The company visited on 27 September 2022.</li>
                    <li> The company had multiple profiles to choose from - CloudSW, Embedded, MTT, SIT, IT
                    Product Security, Python Automation Engineer, and Engineering Services.</li>
                    <li> The very first round was shortlisting based on resumes followed by the online test.</li>
                    <li> The online test was on the Mettl platform, which had 55 MCQs divided into two sections
                    of 35 (Aptitude) and 20 (Technical Questions), and the duration was 60 minutes.</li>
                    <li> The first section was based on Aptitude (Permutations and Combinations, Basic
                    Arithmetic, Calendar Question, etc), logical reasoning and Verbal Ability.</li>
                    <li> The second section consisted of 20 technical questions( in Embedded, Analog and
                    Digital, and Network Analysis).</li>
                    <li> There was no negative marking for incorrect answers. Even if you are unsure, try to
                    provide your approach to each and every question.</li>
                    <li> Questions in the digital profile test appeared to be from the college syllabus, including
                    Analog Microelectronics, Analysis and Design of Digital Circuits, Digital VLSI Design,
                    AICD and Network Analysis (3rd Sem mostly).</li>
                    <li> The first section was easy to moderate level while the second section was on the
                    tougher side considering the time provided.</li>
                    <li> The results were out the next morning followed by the interviews.</li>
                    <li> A total of 12 students were shortlisted for the interviews.</li>
                    </p>


                <h2 class="section-heading">Interview Round</h2>

                <p>The interview consisted of two rounds. The first round was a technical round and the second
                    round was a (Technical + HR) round.</p>

                    <li> There were 2 interviewers in the first round.</li>
                    <li>They first introduced themselves and the projects they are working on. As expected the
                    first question was to introduce yourself. When I told them about my project he asked me
                    to explain it in detail.</li>
                    <li> About half of my interview was purely based on my projects and internships, since it was
                    related to the domain they are looking for.</li>
                    <li> They asked questions related to SPI, UART and bus protocols. How many wires are
                    required for SPI communication, parity bits in UART communication, START bit and
                    STOP bit, etc?</li>
                    <li> The understanding of the C programming language was rigorously examined and was
                    questioned on a variety of topics related to recursion, pointers, linked lists, arrays,
                    strings, macros and Functions, storage classes, Memory Allocation, etc.</li>
                    <li> Brief questions were asked on Thevenin's theorem and KVL/KCL.</li>
                    <li> There were questions concerning operating systems and the implementation of various
                    software interrupts in Linux operating systems.</li>
                    <li> Some logical questions about sensors and Arduino were asked to test the thinking
                    process.</li>

                   <p>The second round was a technical plus HR round. Three students were shortlisted for the
                    second round.</p> 
                    <p>
                    <li> The first question was to tell me something about yourself.</li>
                    <li> It mostly consisted of questions from Microprocessors and Microcontrollers, OS and C
                    Programming. We talked about several fundamental MPMC principles including
                    endianness, DMA, and bus design.</li>
                    <li> Fundamental questions related to 8085,8086 and 8051.</li>
                    <li> Regarding my prior interview experiences, the firms I applied to and why I was not
                    selected?</li>
                    <li> What do you know about Enphase?</li>
                    <li> The interviewer wanted to know if I intended to pursue an MS (it's always a sensible
                    move to answer no to this question) and if not, why?</li>
                    <li> My future plans and ambitions.</li></p>
